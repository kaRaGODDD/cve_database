# [CVE-2017-15114](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-15114)

## Description

- `When libvirtd is configured by OSP director (tripleo-heat-templates) to use the TLS transport it defaults to the same certificate authority as all non-libvirtd services. As no additional authentication is configured this allows these services to connect to libvirtd (which is equivalent to root access). If a vulnerability exists in another service it could, combined with this flaw, be exploited to escalate privileges to gain control over compute nodes.`
