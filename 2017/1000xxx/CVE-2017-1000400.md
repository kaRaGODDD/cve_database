# [CVE-2017-1000400](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-1000400)

## Description

- `The Jenkins 2.73.1 and earlier, 2.83 and earlier remote API at /job/(job-name)/api contained information about upstream and downstream projects. This included information about tasks that the current user otherwise has no access to, e.g. due to lack of Item/Read permission. This has been fixed, and the API now only lists upstream and downstream projects that the current user has access to.`
