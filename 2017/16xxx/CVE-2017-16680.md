# [CVE-2017-16680](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-16680)

## Description

- `Two potential audit log injections in SAP HANA extended application services 1.0, advanced model: 1) Certain HTTP/REST endpoints of controller service are missing user input validation which could allow unprivileged attackers to forge audit log lines. Hence the interpretation of audit log files could be hindered or misdirected. 2) User Account and Authentication writes audit logs into syslog and additionally writes the same audit entries into a log file. Entries in the log file miss escaping. Hence the interpretation of audit log files could be hindered or misdirected, while the entries in syslog are correct.`
