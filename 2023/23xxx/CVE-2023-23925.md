# [CVE-2023-23925](https://github.com/switcherapi/switcher-client-master/releases/tag/v3.1.4)

## Description

- `Switcher Client is a JavaScript SDK to work with Switcher API which is cloud-based Feature Flag. Unsanitized input flows into Strategy match operation (EXIST), where it is used to build a regular expression. This may result in a Regular expression Denial of Service attack (reDOS). This issue has been patched in version 3.1.4. As a workaround, avoid using Strategy settings that use REGEX in conjunction with EXIST and NOT_EXIST operations.
