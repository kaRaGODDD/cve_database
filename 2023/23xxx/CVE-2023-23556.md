# [CVE-2023-23556](https://github.com/facebook/hermes/commit/a6dcafe6ded8e61658b40f5699878cd19a481f80)

## Description

- `An error in BigInt conversion to Number in Hermes prior to commit a6dcafe6ded8e61658b40f5699878cd19a481f80 could have been used by a malicious attacker to execute arbitrary code due to an out-of-bound write. Note that this bug is only exploitable in cases where Hermes is used to execute untrusted JavaScript. Hence, most React Native applications are not affected.`
