## Description

- `This flaw allows a malicious HTTP server to set "super cookies" in curl thatare then passed back to more origins than what is otherwise allowed orpossible. This allows a site to set cookies that then would get sent todifferent and unrelated sites and domains.It could do this by exploiting a mixed case flaw in curl's function thatverifies a given cookie domain against the Public Suffix List (PSL). Forexample a cookie could be set with `domain=co.UK` when the URL used a lowercase hostname `curl.co.uk`, even though `co.uk` is listed as a PSL domain.`
