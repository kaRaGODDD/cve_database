# [CVE-2023-35948](https://github.com/novuhq/novu/pull/3510)

## Description

- `Novu provides an API for sending notifications through multiple channels. Versions prior to 0.16.0 contain an open redirect vulnerability in the "Sign In with GitHub" functionality of Novu's open-source repository. It could have allowed an attacker to force a victim into opening a malicious URL and thus, potentially log into the repository under the victim's account gaining full control of the account. This vulnerability only affected the Novu Cloud and Open-Source deployments if the user manually enabled the GitHub OAuth on their self-hosted instance of Novu. Users should upgrade to version 0.16.0 to receive a patch.`
