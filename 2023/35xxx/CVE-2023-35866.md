# [CVE-2023-35866](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-35866)

## Description

- `In KeePassXC through 2.7.5, a local attacker can make changes to the Database security settings, including master password and second-factor authentication, within an authenticated KeePassXC Database session, without the need to authenticate these changes by entering the password and/or second-factor authentication to confirm changes. NOTE: the vendor's position is "asking the user for their password prior to making any changes to the database settings adds no additional protection against a local attacker."`
