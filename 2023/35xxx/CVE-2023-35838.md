# [CVE-2023-35838](https://psirt.global.sonicwall.com/vuln-detail/SNWLID-2023-0015)

## Description

- `The WireGuard client 0.5.3 on Windows insecurely configures the operating system and firewall such that traffic to a local network that uses non-RFC1918 IP addresses is blocked. This allows an adversary to trick the victim into blocking IP traffic to selected IP addresses and services even while the VPN is enabled. NOTE: the tunnelcrack.mathyvanhoef.com website uses this CVE ID to refer more generally to "LocalNet attack resulting in the blocking of traffic" rather than to only WireGuard.`
