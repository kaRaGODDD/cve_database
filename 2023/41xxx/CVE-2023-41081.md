# [CVE-2023-41081](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/09/28/7)

## Description

- `Important: Authentication Bypass CVE-2023-41081

The mod_jk component of Apache Tomcat Connectors in some circumstances, such as when a configuration included "JkOptions +ForwardDirectories" but the configuration did not       provide explicit mounts for all possible proxied requests, mod_jk would       use an implicit mapping and map the request to the first defined worker. Such an implicit mapping could result in the unintended exposure of the status worker and/or bypass security constraints configured in httpd. As of JK 1.2.49, the implicit mapping functionality has been removed and all mappings must now be via explicit configuration. Only mod_jk is affected by this issue. The ISAPI redirector is not affected.

This issue affects Apache Tomcat Connectors (mod_jk only): from 1.2.0 through 1.2.48.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 1.2.49, which fixes the issue.
