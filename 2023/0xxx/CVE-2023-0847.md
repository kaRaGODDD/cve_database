# [CVE-2023-0847](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-0847)

## Description

- `The Sub-IoT implementation of the DASH 7 Alliance protocol has a vulnerability that can lead to an out-of-bounds write prior to implementation version 0.5.0. If the protocol has been compiled using default settings, this will only grant the attacker access to allocated but unused memory. However, if it was configured using non-default settings, there is the possibility that exploiting this vulnerability could lead to system crashes and remote code execution.`
