# [CVE-2023-26456](https://documentation.open-xchange.com/appsuite/security/advisories/csaf/2023/oxas-adv-2023-0004.json)

## Description

- `Users were able to set an arbitrary "product name" for OX Guard. The chosen value was not sufficiently sanitized before processing it at the user interface, allowing for indirect cross-site scripting attacks. Accounts that were temporarily taken over could be configured to trigger persistent code execution, allowing an attacker to build a foothold. Sanitization is in place for product names now. No publicly available exploits are known.
