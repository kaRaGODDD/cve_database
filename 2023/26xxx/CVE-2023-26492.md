Directus is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) when importing a file from a remote web server (POST to `/files/import`). An attacker can bypass the security controls by performing a DNS rebinding attack and view sensitive data from internal servers or perform a local port scan. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to access highly sensitive internal server(s) and steal sensitive information. This issue was fixed in version 9.23.0.`
