# [CVE-2023-25718](https://cybir.com/2022/cve/connectwise-control-dns-spoofing-poc/)

## Description

- `In ConnectWise Control through 22.9.10032 (formerly known as ScreenConnect), after an executable file is signed, additional instructions can be added without invalidating the signature, such as instructions that result in offering the end user a (different) attacker-controlled executable file. It is plausible that the end user may allow the download and execution of this file to proceed. There are ConnectWise Control configuration options that add mitigations. NOTE: this may overlap CVE-2023-25719. NOTE: the vendor's position is that this purported vulnerability represents a "fundamental lack of understanding of Authenticode code signing behavior."`
