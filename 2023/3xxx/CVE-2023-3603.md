
# [CVE-2023-3603](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-3603)

## Description

- `A missing allocation check in sftp server processing read requests may cause a NULL dereference on low-memory conditions. The malicious client can request up to 4GB SFTP reads, causing allocation of up to 4GB buffers, which was not being checked for failure. This will likely crash the authenticated user's sftp server connection (if implemented as forking as recommended). For thread-based servers, this might also cause DoS for legitimate users.Given this code is not in any released versions, no security releases have been issued.`
