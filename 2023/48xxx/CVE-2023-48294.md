# [CVE-2023-48294](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-48294)

## Description

- `LibreNMS is an auto-discovering PHP/MySQL/SNMP based network monitoring which includes support for a wide range of network hardware and operating systems. In affected versions of LibreNMS when a user accesses their device dashboard, one request is sent to `graph.php` to access graphs generated on the particular Device. This request can be accessed by a low privilege user and they can enumerate devices on librenms with their id or hostname. Leveraging this vulnerability a low privilege user can see all devices registered by admin users. This vulnerability has been addressed in commit `489978a923` which has been included in release version 23.11.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.`
