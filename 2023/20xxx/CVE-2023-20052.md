## Description

- `On Feb 15, 2023, the following vulnerability in the ClamAV scanning library was disclosed:
  A vulnerability in the DMG file parser of ClamAV versions 1.0.0 and earlier, 0.105.1 and earlier, and 0.103.7 and earlier could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access sensitive information on an affected device.
  This vulnerability is due to enabling XML entity substitution that may result in XML external entity injection.
