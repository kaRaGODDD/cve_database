## Description

- `A vulnerability in the scanning engines of Cisco AsyncOS Software for Cisco Secure Web Appliance could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass a configured rule, allowing traffic onto a network that should have been blocked.
 This vulnerability is due to improper detection of malicious traffic when the traffic is encoded with a specific content format. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using an affected device to connect to a malicious server and receiving crafted HTTP responses. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass an explicit block rule and receive traffic that should have been rejected by the device.`
