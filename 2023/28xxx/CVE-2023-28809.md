# [CVE-2023-28809](http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/174506/Hikvision-Access-Control-Session-Hijacking.html)

## Description

- `Some access control products are vulnerable to a session hijacking attack because the product does not update the session ID after a user successfully logs in. To exploit the vulnerability, attackers have to request the session ID at the same time as a valid user logs in, and gain device operation permissions by forging the IP and session ID of an authenticated user.`
