# [CVE-2023-28143](https://qualys.com/security-advisories)

## Description

- `
Qualys Cloud Agent for macOS (versions 2.5.1-75 before 3.7)
installer allows a local escalation of privilege bounded only to the time of
installation and only on older macOSX (macOS 10.15 and older) versions.
Attackers may exploit incorrect file permissions to give them ROOT command
execution privileges on the host. During the install of the PKG, a step in the
process involves extracting the package and copying files to several
directories. Attackers may gain writable access to files during the install of
PKG when extraction of the package and copying files to several directories,
enabling a local escalation of privilege.
