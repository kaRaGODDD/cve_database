# [CVE-2023-29723](https://github.com/LianKee/SO-CVEs/blob/main/CVEs/CVE-2023-29723/CVE%20detail.md)

## Description

- `The Glitter Unicorn Wallpaper app for Android 7.0 thru 8.0 allows unauthorized applications to actively request permission to insert data into the database that records information about a user's personal preferences and will be loaded into memory to be read and used when the application is opened. By injecting data, the attacker can force the application to load malicious image URLs and display them in the UI. As the amount of data increases, it will eventually cause the application to trigger an OOM error and crash, resulting in a persistent denial of service attack.`
