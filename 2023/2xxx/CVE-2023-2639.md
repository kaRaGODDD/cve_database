# [CVE-2023-2639](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-2639)

## Description

- `The underlying feedback mechanism of Rockwell Automation's FactoryTalk System Services that transfers the FactoryTalk Policy Manager rules to relevant devices on the network does not verify that the origin of the communication is from a legitimate local client device.  This may allow a threat actor to craft a malicious website that, when visited, will send a malicious script that can connect to the local WebSocket endpoint and wait for events as if it was a valid client device. If successfully exploited, this would allow a threat actor to receive information including whether FactoryTalk Policy Manager is installed and potentially the entire security policy.`
