## Description

- `The FiboSearch - AJAX Search for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via admin settings in versions up to, and including, 1.23.0  due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.

This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.`
