# [CVE-2023-2084](https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/essential-blocks/tags/4.0.6/includes/Admin/Admin.php)

## Description

- `The Essential Blocks plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized use of functionality due to a missing capability check on the get function in versions up to, and including, 4.0.6. This makes it possible for subscriber-level attackers to obtain plugin settings. While a nonce check is present, it is only executed when a nonce is provided. Not providing a nonce results in the nonce verification to be skipped. There is no capability check.`
