# [CVE-2023-38039](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2023/Oct/17)

## Description

- `When curl retrieves an HTTP response, it stores the incoming headers so that
they can be accessed later via the libcurl headers API.

However, curl did not have a limit in how many or how large headers it would
accept in a response, allowing a malicious server to stream an endless series
of headers and eventually cause curl to run out of heap memory.`
