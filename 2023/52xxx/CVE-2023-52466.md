## Description

- `In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:PCI: Avoid potential out-of-bounds read in pci_dev_for_each_resource()Coverity complains that pointer in the pci_dev_for_each_resource() may bewrong, i.e., might be used for the out-of-bounds read.There is no actual issue right now because we have another check afterwardsand the out-of-bounds read is not being performed. In any case it's bettercode with this fixed, hence the proposed change.As Jonas pointed out "It probably makes the code slightly less performantas res will now be checked for being not NULL (which will always be true),but I doubt it will be significant (or in any hot paths)."`
