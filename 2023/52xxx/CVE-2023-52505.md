## Description

- `In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:phy: lynx-28g: serialize concurrent phy_set_mode_ext() calls to shared registersThe protocol converter configuration registers PCC8, PCCC, PCCD(implemented by the driver), as well as others, control protocolconverters from multiple lanes (each represented as a differentstruct phy). So, if there are simultaneous calls to phy_set_mode_ext()to lanes sharing the same PCC register (either for the "old" or for the"new" protocol), corruption of the values programmed to hardware ispossible, because lynx_28g_rmw() has no locking.Add a spinlock in the struct lynx_28g_priv shared by all lanes, and takethe global spinlock from the phy_ops :: set_mode() implementation. Thereare no other callers which modify PCC registers.`
