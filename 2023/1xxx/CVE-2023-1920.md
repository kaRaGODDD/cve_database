- `The WP Fastest Cache plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.1.2.

This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to purge the varnish cache via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.`
