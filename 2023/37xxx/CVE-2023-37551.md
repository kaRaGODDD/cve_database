# [CVE-2023-37551](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-37551)

## Description

- `In multiple Codesys products in multiple versions, after successful authentication as a user, specially crafted network communication requests can utilize the CmpApp component to download files with any file extensions to the controller. In contrast to the regular file download via CmpFileTransfer, no filtering of certain file types is performed here. As a result, the integrity of the CODESYS control runtime system may be compromised by the files loaded onto the controller.`
