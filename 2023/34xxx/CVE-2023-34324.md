# [CVE-2023-34324](https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/01/msg00004.html)

## Description

- `Closing of an event channel in the Linux kernel can result in a deadlock.This happens when the close is being performed in parallel to an unrelatedXen console action and the handling of a Xen console interrupt in anunprivileged guest.The closing of an event channel is e.g. triggered by removal of aparavirtual device on the other side. As this action will cause consolemessages to be issued on the other side quite often, the chance oftriggering the deadlock is not neglectable.Note that 32-bit Arm-guests are not affected, as the 32-bit Linux kernelon Arm doesn't use queued-RW-locks, which are required to trigger theissue (on Arm32 a waiting writer doesn't block further readers to getthe lock).`
