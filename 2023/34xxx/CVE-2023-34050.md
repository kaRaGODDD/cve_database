# [CVE-2023-34050](https://spring.io/security/cve-2023-34050)

## Description

- `









In spring AMQP versions 1.0.0 to
2.4.16 and 3.0.0 to 3.0.9 , allowed list patterns for deserializable class
names were added to Spring AMQP, allowing users to lock down deserialization of
data in messages from untrusted sources; however by default, when no allowed
list was provided, all classes could be deserialized.



Specifically, an application is
vulnerable if




   *  the
     SimpleMessageConverter or SerializerMessageConverter is used

   *  the user
     does not configure allowed list patterns

   *  untrusted
     message originators gain permissions to write messages to the RabbitMQ
     broker to send malicious content
