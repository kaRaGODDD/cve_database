# [CVE-2023-34322](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-34322)

## Description

- `For migration as well as to work around kernels unaware of L1TF (seeXSA-273), PV guests may be run in shadow paging mode.  Since Xen itselfneeds to be mapped when PV guests run, Xen and shadowed PV guests rundirectly the respective shadow page tables.  For 64-bit PV guests thismeans running on the shadow of the guest root page table.In the course of dealing with shortage of memory in the shadow poolassociated with a domain, shadows of page tables may be torn down.  Thistearing down may include the shadow root page table that the CPU inquestion is presently running on.  While a precaution exists tosupposedly prevent the tearing down of the underlying live page table,the time window covered by that precaution isn't large enough.`
