After furtheranalisys the Xen Security Team is no longer confident in the suitability oflibfsimage when run against guest controlled input with super user priviledges.In order to not affect current deployments that rely on pygrub patches areprovided in the resolution section of the advisory that allow running pygrub indeprivileged mode.CVE-2023-4949 refers to the original issue in the upstream grubproject ("An attacker with local access to a system (either through adisk or external drive) can present a modified XFS partition togrub-legacy in such a way to exploit a memory corruption in grubâ€™s XFSfile system implementation.")  CVE-2023-34325 refers specifically tothe vulnerabilities in Xen's copy of libfsimage, which is decendedfrom a very old version of grub.`
