## Description

- `Prior to commit 51867e0d15a6d7f80d5b714fd0e9976b9c160bb0, https://github.com/brave/adblock-lists removed redirect interceptors on some websites like Facebook in which the redirect interceptor may have been there for security purposes. This could potentially cause open redirects on these websites. Brave's redirect interceptor removal feature is known as "debouncing" and is intended to remove unnecessary redirects that track users across the web.`
