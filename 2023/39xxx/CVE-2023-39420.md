# [CVE-2023-39420](https://bitdefender.com/blog/labs/check-out-with-extra-charges-vulnerabilities-in-hotel-booking-engine-explained/)

## Description

- `The RDPCore.dll component as used in the IRM Next Generation booking engine, allows a remote user to connect to customers with an "admin" account and a corresponding password computed daily by a routine inside the DLL file. Once reverse-engineered, this routine can help an attacker generate the daily password and connect to application customers. Given that this is an administrative account, anyone logging into a customer deployment has full, unrestricted access to the application.`
