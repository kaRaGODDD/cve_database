
# [CVE-2023-39332](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-39332)

## Description

- `Various `node:fs` functions allow specifying paths as either strings or `Uint8Array` objects. In Node.js environments, the `Buffer` class extends the `Uint8Array` class. Node.js prevents path traversal through strings (see CVE-2023-30584) and `Buffer` objects (see CVE-2023-32004), but not through non-`Buffer` `Uint8Array` objects.This is distinct from CVE-2023-32004 which only referred to `Buffer` objects. However, the vulnerability follows the same pattern using `Uint8Array` instead of `Buffer`.Please note that at the time this CVE was issued, the permission model is an experimental feature of Node.js.`
