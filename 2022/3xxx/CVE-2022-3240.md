# [CVE-2022-3240](https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/follow-me/trunk/follow-me.php#L261)

## Description

- `The "Follow Me Plugin" plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 3.1.1. This is due to missing nonce validation on the FollowMeIgniteSocialMedia_options_page() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify the plugin's settings and inject malicious JavaScript via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.`
