# [CVE-2022-25328](https://github.com/google/fscrypt/pull/346)

## Description

- `The bash_completion script for fscrypt allows injection of commands via crafted mountpoint paths, allowing privilege escalation under a specific set of circumstances. A local user who has control over mountpoint paths could potentially escalate their privileges if they create a malicious mountpoint path and if the system administrator happens to be using the fscrypt bash completion script to complete mountpoint paths. We recommend upgrading to version 0.3.3 or above`
