# [CVE-2022-4304](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-4304)

## Description

- `A timing based side channel exists in the OpenSSL RSA Decryption implementationwhich could be sufficient to recover a plaintext across a network in aBleichenbacher style attack. To achieve a successful decryption an attackerwould have to be able to send a very large number of trial messages fordecryption. The vulnerability affects all RSA padding modes: PKCS#1 v1.5,RSA-OEAP and RSASVE.For example, in a TLS connection, RSA is commonly used by a client to send anencrypted pre-master secret to the server. An attacker that had observed agenuine connection between a client and a server could use this flaw to sendtrial messages to the server and record the time taken to process them. After asufficiently large number of messages the attacker could recover the pre-mastersecret used for the original connection and thus be able to decrypt theapplication data sent over that connection.`
