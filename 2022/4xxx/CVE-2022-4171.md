# [CVE-2022-4171](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-4171)

## Description

- `The demon image annotation plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to improper input validation in versions up to, and including 5.0. This is due to the plugin improperly validating the number of characters supplied during an annotation despite there being a setting to limit the number characters input. This means that unauthenticated attackers can bypass the length restrictions and input more characters than allowed via the settings.`
