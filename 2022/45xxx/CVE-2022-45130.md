## Description

- `Plesk Obsidian allows a CSRF attack, e.g., via the /api/v2/cli/commands REST API to change an Admin password. NOTE: Obsidian is a specific version of the Plesk product: version numbers were used through version 12, and then the convention was changed so that versions are identified by names ("Obsidian"), not numbers.`
