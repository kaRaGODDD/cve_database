# [CVE-2022-24139](http://advanced.com)

## Description

- `In IOBit Advanced System Care (AscService.exe) 15, an attacker with SEImpersonatePrivilege can create a named pipe with the same name as one of ASCService's named pipes. ASCService first tries to connect before trying to create the named pipes, because of that during login the service will try to connect to the attacker which will lead to either escalation of privileges (through token manipulation and ImpersonateNamedPipeClient() ) from ADMIN -> SYSTEM or from Local ADMIN-> Domain ADMIN depending on the user and named pipe that is used.`
