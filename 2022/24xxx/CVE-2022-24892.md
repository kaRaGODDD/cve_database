# [CVE-2022-24892](https://docs.shopware.com/en/shopware-5-en/security-updates/security-update-04-2022)

## Description

- `Shopware is an open source e-commerce software platform. Starting with version 5.0.4 and before version 5.7.9, multiple tokens for password reset can be requested. All tokens can be used to change the password. This makes it possible for an attacker to take over the victim's account if they somehow gain access to the victims email account and find an unused password reset token in the emails. This issue is fixed in version 5.7.9.`
