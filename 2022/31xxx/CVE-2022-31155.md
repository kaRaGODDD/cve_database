# [CVE-2022-31155](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-31155)

## Description

- `Sourcegraph is an opensource code search and navigation engine. In Sourcegraph versions before 3.41.0, it is possible for an attacker to delete other users’ saved searches due to a bug in the authorization check. The vulnerability does not allow the reading of other users’ saved searches, only overwriting them with attacker-controlled searches. The issue is patched in Sourcegraph version 3.41.0. There is no workaround for this issue and updating to a secure version is highly recommended.`
