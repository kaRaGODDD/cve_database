## Description

- `Gogs is an open source self-hosted Git service. In versions of gogs prior to 0.12.9 `DisplayName` does not filter characters input from users, which leads to an XSS vulnerability when directly displayed in the issue list.

Users unable to upgrade should check their users' display names for malicious characters.`
