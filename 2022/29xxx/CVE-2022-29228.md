# [CVE-2022-29228](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/commit/7ffda4e809dec74449ebc330cebb9d2f4ab61360)

## Description

- `Envoy is a cloud-native high-performance proxy. In versions prior to 1.22.1 the OAuth filter would try to invoke the remaining filters in the chain after emitting a local response, which triggers an ASSERT() in newer versions and corrupts memory on earlier versions. continueDecoding() shouldnâ€™t ever be called from filters after a local reply has been sent. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.`
