# [CVE-2022-36014](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-36014)

## Description

- `TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. When `mlir::tfg::TFOp::nameAttr` receives null type list attributes, it crashes. We have patched the issue in GitHub commits 3a754740d5414e362512ee981eefba41561a63a6 and a0f0b9a21c9270930457095092f558fbad4c03e5. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.10.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.9.1, TensorFlow 2.8.1, and TensorFlow 2.7.2, as these are also affected and still in supported range. There are no known workarounds for this issue.`
