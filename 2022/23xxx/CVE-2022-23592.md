# [CVE-2022-23592](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-23592)

## Description

- `Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. TensorFlow's type inference can cause a heap out of bounds read as the bounds checking is done in a `DCHECK` (which is a no-op during production). An attacker can control the `input_idx` variable such that `ix` would be larger than the number of values in `node_t.args`. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. This is the only affected version.`
