# [CVE-2022-23709](https://discuss.elastic.co/t/elastic-stack-7-17-1-security-update/298447)

## Description

- `A flaw was discovered in Kibana in which users with Read access to the Uptime feature could modify alerting rules. A user with this privilege would be able to create new alerting rules or overwrite existing ones. However, any new or modified rules would not be enabled, and a user with this privilege could not modify alerting connectors. This effectively means that Read users could disable existing alerting rules.`
