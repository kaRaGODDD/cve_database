# [CVE-2022-23498](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/security/advisories/GHSA-2j8f-6whh-frc8)

## Description

- `Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. When datasource query caching is enabled, Grafana caches all headers, including `grafana_session`. As a result, any user that queries a datasource where the caching is enabled can acquire another userâ€™s session. To mitigate the vulnerability you can disable datasource query caching for all datasources. This issue has been patched in versions 9.2.10 and 9.3.4.
