The web server fails to sanitize admin/cgi-bin/rulemgr.pl/getfile/ input data, allowing a remote authenticated administrator to read arbitrary files on the system via Directory Traversal. By manipulating the resource name in GET requests referring to files with absolute paths, it is possible to access arbitrary files stored on the filesystem, including application source code, configuration files, and critical system files.`
