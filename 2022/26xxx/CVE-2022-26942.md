# [CVE-2022-26942](https://tetraburst.com/)

## Description

- `The Motorola MTM5000 series firmwares lack pointer validation on arguments passed to trusted execution environment (TEE) modules. Two modules are used, one responsible for KVL key management and the other for TETRA cryptographic functionality. In both modules, an adversary with non-secure supervisor level code execution can exploit the issue in order to gain secure supervisor code execution within the TEE. This constitutes a full break of the TEE module, exposing the device key as well as any TETRA cryptographic keys and the confidential TETRA cryptographic primitives. `
