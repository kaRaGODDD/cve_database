# [CVE-2022-2001](https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/dx-share-selection/trunk/dx-share-selection.php#L284)

## Description

- `The DX Share Selection plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including 1.4. This is due to missing nonce protection on the dxss_admin_page() function found in the ~/dx-share-selection.php file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject malicious web scripts into the page, granted they can trick a site's administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.`
