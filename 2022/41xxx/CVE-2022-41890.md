# [CVE-2022-41890](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-41890)

## Description

- `TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. If `BCast::ToShape` is given input larger than an `int32`, it will crash, despite being supposed to handle up to an `int64`. An example can be seen in `tf.experimental.numpy.outer` by passing in large input to the input `b`. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit 8310bf8dd188ff780e7fc53245058215a05bdbe5. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.11. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.10.1, 2.9.3, and TensorFlow 2.8.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.`
