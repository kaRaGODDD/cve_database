# [CVE-2022-39334](https://github.com/nextcloud/desktop/issues/4927)

## Description

- `Nextcloud also ships a CLI utility called nextcloudcmd which is sometimes used for automated scripting and headless servers. Versions of nextcloudcmd prior to 3.6.1 would incorrectly trust invalid TLS certificates, which may enable a Man-in-the-middle attack that exposes sensitive data or credentials to a network attacker. This affects the CLI only. It does not affect the standard GUI desktop Nextcloud clients, and it does not affect the Nextcloud server.`
