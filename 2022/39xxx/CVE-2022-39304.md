# [CVE-2022-39304](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/building-github-apps/authenticating-with-github-apps#authenticating-as-an-installation)

## Description

- `ghinstallation provides transport, which implements http.RoundTripper to provide authentication as an installation for GitHub Apps. In ghinstallation version 1, when the request to refresh an installation token failed, the HTTP request and response would be returned for debugging. The request contained the bearer JWT for the App, and was returned back to clients. This token is short lived (10 minute maximum). This issue has been patched and is available in version 2.0.0.
