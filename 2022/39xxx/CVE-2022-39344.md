# [CVE-2022-39344](https://github.com/azure-rtos/usbx/security/advisories/GHSA-m9p8-xrp7-vvqp)

## Description

- `Azure RTOS USBX is a USB host, device, and on-the-go (OTG) embedded stack, that is fully integrated with Azure RTOS ThreadX. Prior to version 6.1.12, the USB DFU UPLOAD functionality may be utilized to introduce a buffer overflow resulting in overwrite of memory contents. In particular cases this may allow an attacker to bypass security features or execute arbitrary code. The implementation of `ux_device_class_dfu_control_request` function prevents buffer overflow during handling of DFU UPLOAD command when current state is `UX_SYSTEM_DFU_STATE_DFU_IDLE`. This issue has been patched, please upgrade to version 6.1.12. As a workaround, add the `UPLOAD_LENGTH` check in all possible states.`
