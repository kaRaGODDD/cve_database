# [CVE-2022-1318](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-1318)

## Description

- `Hills ComNav version 3002-19 suffers from a weak communication channel. Traffic across the local network for the configuration pages can be viewed by a malicious actor. The size of certain communications packets are predictable. This would allow an attacker to learn the state of the system if they can observe the traffic. This would be possible even if the traffic were encrypted, e.g., using WPA2, as the packet sizes would remain observable. The communication encryption scheme is theoretically sound, but is not strong enough for the level of protection required.`
