# [CVE-2022-1158](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-1158)

## Description

- `A flaw was found in KVM. When updating a guest's page table entry, vm_pgoff was improperly used as the offset to get the page's pfn. As vaddr and vm_pgoff are controllable by user-mode processes, this flaw allows unprivileged local users on the host to write outside the userspace region and potentially corrupt the kernel, resulting in a denial of service condition.`
