# [CVE-2022-44794](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-44794)

## Description

- `An issue was discovered in Object First Ootbi BETA build 1.0.7.712. Management protocol has a flow which allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary Bash code with root privileges. The command that sets the hostname doesn't validate input parameters. As a result, arbitrary data goes directly to the Bash interpreter. An attacker would need credentials to exploit this vulnerability. This is fixed in Object First Ootbi BETA build 1.0.13.1611.`
