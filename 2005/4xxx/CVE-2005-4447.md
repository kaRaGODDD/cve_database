# [CVE-2005-4447](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-4447)

## Description

- `SQL injection vulnerability in articles\articles_funcs.php in phpCOIN 1.2.2 allows remote attackers to modify SQL syntax and possibly execute SQL in limited circumstances via the rec_next parameter. NOTE: the original disclosure suggests that command injection is not feasible because the injection occurs after an "ORDER BY" clause, but it is likely that this bug could result in an error message path disclosure due to a syntax error, in some environments.  Therefore this is an exposure and should be included in CVE.`
