# [CVE-2005-3399](http://marc.info/?l=bugtraq&m=113026417802703&w=2)

## Description

- `Multiple interpretation error in CAT-QuickHeal 8.0 allows remote attackers to bypass virus scanning via a file such as BAT, HTML, and EML with an "MZ" magic byte sequence which is normally associated with EXE, which causes the file to be treated as a safe type that could still be executed as a dangerous file type by applications on the end system, as demonstrated by a "triple headed" program that contains EXE, EML, and HTML content, aka the "magic byte bug."`
