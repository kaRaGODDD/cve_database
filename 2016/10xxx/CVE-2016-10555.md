# [CVE-2016-10555](https://auth0.com/blog/2015/03/31/critical-vulnerabilities-in-json-web-token-libraries/)

## Description

- `Since "algorithm" isn't enforced in jwt.decode()in jwt-simple 0.3.0 and earlier, a malicious user could choose what algorithm is sent sent to the server. If the server is expecting RSA but is sent HMAC-SHA with RSA's public key, the server will think the public key is actually an HMAC private key. This could be used to forge any data an attacker wants.`
