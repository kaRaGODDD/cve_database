# [CVE-2016-8385](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-8385)

## Description

- `An exploitable uninitialized variable vulnerability which leads to a stack-based buffer overflow exists in Iceni Argus. When it attempts to convert a malformed PDF to XML a stack variable will be left uninitialized which will later be used to fetch a length that is used in a copy operation. In most cases this will allow an aggressor to write outside the bounds of a stack buffer which is used to contain colors. This can lead to code execution under the context of the account running the tool.`
