# [CVE-2016-9094](http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/96298)

## Description

- `Symantec Endpoint Protection clients place detected malware in quarantine as part of the intended product functionality. The quarantine logs can be exported for review by the user in a variety of formats including .CSV files. Prior to 14.0 MP1 and 12.1 RU6 MP7, the potential exists for file metadata to be interpreted and evaluated as a formula. Successful exploitation of an attack of this type requires considerable direct user-interaction from the user exporting and then opening the log files on the intended target client.`
