## Description

- `Untrusted search path vulnerability in the installation functionality in ActivePython 3.2.2.3, when installed in the top-level C:\ directory, might allow local users to gain privileges via a Trojan horse DLL in the C:\Python27 or C:\Python27\Scripts directory, which may be added to the PATH system environment variable by an administrator, as demonstrated by a Trojan horse wlbsctrl.dll file used by the "IKE and AuthIP IPsec Keying Modules" system service in Windows Vista SP1, Windows Server 2008 SP2, Windows 7 SP1, and Windows 8 Release Preview.  NOTE: CVE disputes this issue because the unsafe PATH is established only by a separate administrative action that is not a default part of the ActivePython installation`
