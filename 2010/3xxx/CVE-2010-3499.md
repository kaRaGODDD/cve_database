# [CVE-2010-3499](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-3499)

## Description

- `F-Secure Anti-Virus does not properly interact with the processing of hcp:// URLs by the Microsoft Help and Support Center, which makes it easier for remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via malware that is correctly detected by this product, but with a detection approach that occurs too late to stop the code execution.  NOTE: the researcher indicates that a vendor response was received, stating that "the inability to catch these files are caused by lacking functionality rather than programming errors."`
