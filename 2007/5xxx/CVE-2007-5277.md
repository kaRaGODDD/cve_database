# [CVE-2007-5277](http://crypto.stanford.edu/dns/dns-rebinding.pdf)

## Description

- `Microsoft Internet Explorer 6 drops DNS pins based on failed connections to irrelevant TCP ports, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct DNS rebinding attacks, as demonstrated by a port 81 URL in an IMG SRC, when the DNS pin had been established for a session on port 80, a different issue than CVE-2006-4560.`
