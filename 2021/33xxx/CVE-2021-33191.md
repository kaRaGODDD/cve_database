# [CVE-2021-33191](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-33191)

## Description

- `From Apache NiFi MiNiFi C++ version 0.5.0 the c2 protocol implements an "agent-update" command which was designed to patch the application binary. This "patching" command defaults to calling a trusted binary, but might be modified to an arbitrary value through a "c2-update" command. Said command is then executed using the same privileges as the application binary. This was addressed in version 0.10.0`
