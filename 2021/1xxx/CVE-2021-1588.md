# [CVE-2021-1588](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-1588)

## Description

- `A vulnerability in the MPLS Operation, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) feature of Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to improper input validation when an affected device is processing an MPLS echo-request or echo-reply packet. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious MPLS echo-request or echo-reply packets to an interface that is enabled for MPLS forwarding on the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the MPLS OAM process to crash and restart multiple times, causing the affected device to reload and resulting in a DoS condition.`
