## Description

- `A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco IOS XE Wireless Controller software for the Catalyst 9000 Family of switches could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against another user of the web-based management interface of an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the device as a high-privileged user, adding certain configurations with malicious code in one of its fields, and persuading another user to click on it. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or to access sensitive, browser-based information.`
