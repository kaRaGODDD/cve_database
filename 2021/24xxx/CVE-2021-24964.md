# [CVE-2021-24964](https://wpscan.com/vulnerability/e9966b3e-2eb9-4d70-8c18-6a829b4827cc)

## Description

- `The LiteSpeed Cache WordPress plugin before 4.4.4 does not properly verify that requests are coming from QUIC.cloud servers, allowing attackers to make requests to certain endpoints by using a specific X-Forwarded-For header value. In addition, one of the endpoint could be used to set CSS code if a setting is enabled, which will then be output in some pages without being sanitised and escaped. Combining those two issues, an unauthenticated attacker could put Cross-Site Scripting payloads in pages visited by users.`
