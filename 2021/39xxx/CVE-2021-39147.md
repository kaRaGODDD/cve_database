# [CVE-2021-39147](https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/security/advisories/GHSA-h7v4-7xg3-hxcc)

## Description

- `XStream is a simple library to serialize objects to XML and back again. In affected versions this vulnerability may allow a remote attacker to load and execute arbitrary code from a remote host only by manipulating the processed input stream. No user is affected, who followed the recommendation to setup XStream's security framework with a whitelist limited to the minimal required types. XStream 1.4.18 uses no longer a blacklist by default, since it cannot be secured for general purpose.`
