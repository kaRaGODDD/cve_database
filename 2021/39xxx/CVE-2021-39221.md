# [CVE-2021-39221](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-39221)

## Description

- `Nextcloud is an open-source, self-hosted productivity platform. The Nextcloud Contacts application prior to version 4.0.3 was vulnerable to a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. For exploitation, a user would need to right-click on a malicious file and open the file in a new tab. Due the strict Content-Security-Policy shipped with Nextcloud, this issue is not exploitable on modern browsers supporting Content-Security-Policy. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Contacts application is upgraded to 4.0.3. As a workaround, one may use a browser that has support for Content-Security-Policy.`
