# [CVE-2021-39195](https://github.com/misskey-dev/misskey/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.md#12900-20210904)

## Description

- `Misskey is an open source, decentralized microblogging platform. In affected versions a Server-Side Request Forgery vulnerability exists in "Upload from URL" and remote attachment handling. This could result in the disclosure of non-public information within the internal network. This has been fixed in 12.90.0. However, if you are using a proxy, you will need to take additional measures. As a workaround this exploit may be avoided by appropriately restricting access to private networks from the host where the application is running.`
