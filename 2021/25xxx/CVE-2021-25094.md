# [CVE-2021-25094](http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/167190/WordPress-Tatsu-Builder-Remote-Code-Execution.html)

## Description

- `The Tatsu WordPress plugin before 3.3.12 add_custom_font action can be used without prior authentication to upload a rogue zip file which is uncompressed under the WordPress's upload directory. By adding a PHP shell with a filename starting with a dot ".", this can bypass extension control implemented in the plugin. Moreover, there is a race condition in the zip extraction process which makes the shell file live long enough on the filesystem to be callable by an attacker.`
