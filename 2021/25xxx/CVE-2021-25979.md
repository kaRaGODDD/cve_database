# [CVE-2021-25979](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-25979)

## Description

- `Apostrophe CMS versions prior to 3.3.1 did not invalidate existing login sessions when disabling a user account or changing the password, creating a situation in which a device compromised by a third party could not be locked out by those means. As a mitigation for older releases the user account in question can be archived (3.x) or moved to the trash (2.x and earlier) which does disable the existing session.`
