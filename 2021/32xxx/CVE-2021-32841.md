# [CVE-2021-32841](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-32841)

## Description

- `SharpZipLib (or #ziplib) is a Zip, GZip, Tar and BZip2 library. Starting version 1.3.0 and prior to version 1.3.3, a check was added if the destination file is under destination directory. However, it is not enforced that `destDir` ends with slash. If the `destDir` is not slash terminated like `/home/user/dir` it is possible to create a file with a name thats begins with the destination directory, i.e. `/home/user/dir.sh`. Because of the file name and destination directory constraints, the arbitrary file creation impact is limited and depends on the use case. Version 1.3.3 contains a patch for this vulnerability.`
