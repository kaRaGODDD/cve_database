# [CVE-2021-32489](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-32489)

## Description

- `An issue was discovered in the _send_secure_msg() function of Yubico yubihsm-shell through 2.0.3. The function does not correctly validate the embedded length field of an authenticated message received from the device because response_msg.st.len=8 can be accepted but triggers an integer overflow, which causes CRYPTO_cbc128_decrypt (in OpenSSL) to encounter an undersized buffer and experience a segmentation fault. The yubihsm-shell project is included in the YubiHSM 2 SDK product.`
