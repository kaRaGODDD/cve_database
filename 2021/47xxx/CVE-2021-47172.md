## Description

- `In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:iio: adc: ad7124: Fix potential overflow due to non sequential channel numbersChannel numbering must start at 0 and then not have any holes, orit is possible to overflow the available storage.  Note this bug wasintroduced as part of a fix to ensure we didn't rely on the orderingof child nodes.  So we need to support arbitrary ordering but they allneed to be there somewhere.Note I hit this when using qemu to test the rest of this series.Arguably this isn't the best fix, but it is probably the most minimaloption for backporting etc.Alexandru's sign-off is here because he carried this patch in a largerset that Jonathan then applied.`
