## Description

- `In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:tipc: skb_linearize the head skb when reassembling msgsIt's not a good idea to append the frag skb to a skb's frag_list ifthe frag_list already has skbs from elsewhere, such as this skb wascreated by pskb_copy() where the frag_list was cloned (all the skbsin it were skb_get'ed) and shared by multiple skbs.However, the new appended frag skb should have been only seen by thecurrent skb. Otherwise, it will cause use after free crashes as thisappended frag skb are seen by multiple skbs but it only got skb_getcalled once.The same thing happens with a skb updated by pskb_may_pull() with askb_cloned skb. Li Shuang has reported quite a few crashes causedby this when doing testing over macvlan devices:  [] kernel BUG at net/core/skbuff.c:1970!

Note that we choose to do this before callingskb_unshare(), as __skb_linearize() will avoid skb_copy(). Also, we cannot just drop the frag_list either as the early time.`
