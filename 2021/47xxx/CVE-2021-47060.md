## Description

- `In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:KVM: Stop looking for coalesced MMIO zones if the bus is destroyedAbort the walk of coalesced MMIO zones if kvm_io_bus_unregister_dev()fails to allocate memory for the new instance of the bus.  If it can'tinstantiate a new bus, unregister_dev() destroys all devices _except_ thetarget device.   But, it doesn't tell the caller that it obliterated thebus and invoked the destructor for all devices that were on the bus.  Inthe coalesced MMIO case, this can result in a deleted list entrydereference due to attempting to continue iterating on coalesced_zonesafter future entries (in the walk) have been deleted.Opportunistically add curly braces to the for-loop, which encompassesmany lines but sneaks by without braces due to the guts being a singleif statement.`
