## Description

- `In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/mediatek: hdmi: Perform NULL pointer check for mtk_hdmi_confIn commit 41ca9caaae0b("drm/mediatek: hdmi: Add check for CEA modes only") a checkfor CEA modes was added to function mtk_hdmi_bridge_mode_valid()in order to address possible issues on MT8167;moreover, with commit c91026a938c2("drm/mediatek: hdmi: Add optional limit on maximal HDMI mode clock")another similar check was introduced.Unfortunately though, at the time of writing, MT8173 does not provideany mtk_hdmi_conf structure and this is crashing the kernel with NULLpointer upon entering mtk_hdmi_bridge_mode_valid(), which happens assoon as a HDMI cable gets plugged in.To fix this regression, add a NULL pointer check for hdmi->conf in thesaid function, restoring HDMI functionality and avoiding NULL pointerkernel panics.`
