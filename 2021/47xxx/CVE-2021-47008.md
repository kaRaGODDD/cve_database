## Description

- `In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:KVM: SVM: Make sure GHCB is mapped before updatingAccess to the GHCB is mainly in the VMGEXIT path and it is known that theGHCB will be mapped. But there are two paths where it is possible the GHCBmight not be mapped.The sev_vcpu_deliver_sipi_vector() routine will update the GHCB to informthe caller of the AP Reset Hold NAE event that a SIPI has been delivered.However, if a SIPI is performed without a corresponding AP Reset Hold,then the GHCB might not be mapped (depending on the previous VMEXIT),which will result in a NULL pointer dereference.The svm_complete_emulated_msr() routine will update the GHCB to informthe caller of a RDMSR/WRMSR operation about any errors. While it is likelythat the GHCB will be mapped in this situation, add a safe guardin this path to be certain a NULL pointer dereference is not encountered.`
