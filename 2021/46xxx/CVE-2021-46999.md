## Description

- `In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:sctp: do asoc update earlier in sctp_sf_do_dupcook_aThere's a panic that occurs in a few of envs, the call trace is as below:  [] general protection fault, ... 0x29acd70f1000a: 0000 [#1] SMP PTI  [] RIP: 0010:sctp_ulpevent_notify_peer_addr_change+0x4b/0x1fa [sctp]  []  sctp_assoc_control_transport+0x1b9/0x210 [sctp]  []  sctp_do_8_2_transport_strike.isra.16+0x15c/0x220 [sctp]  []  sctp_cmd_interpreter.isra.21+0x1231/0x1a10 [sctp]  []  sctp_do_sm+0xc3/0x2a0 [sctp]  []  sctp_generate_timeout_event+0x81/0xf0 [sctp]This is caused by a transport use-after-free issue. When processing aduplicate COOKIE-ECHO chunk in sctp_sf_do_dupcook_a(), both COOKIE-ACKand SHUTDOWN chunks are allocated with the transort from the new asoc.However, later in the sideeffect machine, the old asoc is used to sendthem out and old asoc's shutdown_last_sent_to is set to the transportthat SHUTDOWN chunk attached to in sctp_cmd_setup_t2(), which actuallybelongs to the new asoc. After the new_asoc is freed and the old asocT2 timeout, the old asoc's shutdown_last_sent_to that is already freedwould be accessed in sctp_sf_t2_timer_expire().Thanks Alexander and Jere for helping dig into this issue.To fix it, this patch is to do the asoc update first, then allocatethe COOKIE-ACK and SHUTDOWN chunks with the 'updated' old asoc. Thiswould make more sense, as a chunk from an asoc shouldn't be sent outwith another asoc. We had fixed quite a few issues caused by this.`
