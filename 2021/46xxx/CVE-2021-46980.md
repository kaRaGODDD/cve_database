## Description

- `In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:usb: typec: ucsi: Retrieve all the PDOs instead of just the first 4commit 4dbc6a4ef06d ("usb: typec: ucsi: save power data objectsin PD mode") introduced retrieval of the PDOs when connected to aPD-capable source. But only the first 4 PDOs are received sincethat is the maximum number that can be fetched at a time given theMESSAGE_IN length limitation (16 bytes). However, as per the PD speca connected source may advertise up to a maximum of 7 PDOs.If such a source is connected it's possible the PPM could havenegotiated a power contract with one of the PDOs at index greaterthan 4, and would be reflected in the request data object's (RDO)object position field. This would result in an out-of-bounds accesswhen the rdo_index() is used to index into the src_pdos array inucsi_psy_get_voltage_now().With the help of the UBSAN -fsanitize=array-bounds checker enabledthis exact issue is revealed when connecting to a PD source adapterthat advertise 5 PDOs and the PPM enters a contract having selectedthe 5th one.[  151.545106][   T70] Unexpected kernel BRK exception at EL1[  151.545112][   T70] Internal error: BRK handler: f2005512 [#1] PREEMPT SMP...[  151.545499][   T70] pc : ucsi_psy_get_prop+0x208/0x20c[  151.545507][   T70] lr : power_supply_show_property+0xc0/0x328...[  151.545542][   T70] Call trace:[  151.545544][   T70]  ucsi_psy_get_prop+0x208/0x20c[  151.545546][   T70]  power_supply_uevent+0x1a4/0x2f0[  151.545550][   T70]  dev_uevent+0x200/0x384[  151.545555][   T70]  kobject_uevent_env+0x1d4/0x7e8[  151.545557][   T70]  power_supply_changed_work+0x174/0x31c[  151.545562][   T70]  process_one_work+0x244/0x6f0[  151.545564][   T70]  worker_thread+0x3e0/0xa64We can resolve this by instead retrieving and storing up to themaximum of 7 PDOs in the con->src_pdos array. This would involvetwo calls to the GET_PDOS command.`
