# [CVE-2021-46320](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-46320)

## Description

- `In OpenZeppelin <=v4.4.0, initializer functions that are invoked separate from contract creation (the most prominent example being minimal proxies) may be reentered if they make an untrusted non-view external call. Once an initializer has finished running it can never be re-executed. However, an exception put in place to support multiple inheritance made reentrancy possible, breaking the expectation that there is a single execution.`
