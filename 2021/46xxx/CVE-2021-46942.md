## Description

- `In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:io_uring: fix shared sqpoll cancellation hangs[  736.982891] INFO: task iou-sqp-4294:4295 blocked for more than 122 seconds.[  736.982897] Call Trace:[  736.982901]  schedule+0x68/0xe0[  736.982903]  io_uring_cancel_sqpoll+0xdb/0x110[  736.982908]  io_sqpoll_cancel_cb+0x24/0x30[  736.982911]  io_run_task_work_head+0x28/0x50[  736.982913]  io_sq_thread+0x4e3/0x720We call io_uring_cancel_sqpoll() one by one for each ctx either insq_thread() itself or via task works, and it's intended to cancel allrequests of a specified context. However the function uses per-taskcounters to track the number of inflight requests, so it counts morerequests than available via currect io_uring ctx and goes to sleep forthem to appear (e.g. from IRQ), that will never happen.Cancel a bit more than before, i.e. all ctxs that share sqpolland continue to use shared counters. Don't forget that we should notremove ctx from the list before running that task_work sqpoll-cancel,otherwise the function wouldn't be able to find the context and willhang.`
