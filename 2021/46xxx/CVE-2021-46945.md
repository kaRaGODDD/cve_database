## Description

- `In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:ext4: always panic when errors=panic is specifiedBefore commit 014c9caa29d3 ("ext4: make ext4_abort() use__ext4_error()"), the following series of commands would trigger apanic:1. mount /dev/sda -o ro,errors=panic test2. mount /dev/sda -o remount,abort testAfter commit 014c9caa29d3, remounting a file system using the testmount option "abort" will no longer trigger a panic.  This commit willrestore the behaviour immediately before commit 014c9caa29d3.(However, note that the Linux kernel's behavior has not beenconsistent; some previous kernel versions, including 5.4 and 4.19similarly did not panic after using the mount option "abort".)This also makes a change to long-standing behaviour; namely, thefollowing series commands will now cause a panic, when previously itdid not:1. mount /dev/sda -o ro,errors=panic test2. echo test > /sys/fs/ext4/sda/trigger_fs_errorHowever, this makes ext4's behaviour much more consistent, so this isa good thing.`
