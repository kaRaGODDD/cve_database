## Description

- `Proofpoint Insider Threat Management Server contains an unsafe deserialization vulnerability in the Web Console.

When chained with a SQL injection vulnerability, the vulnerability could be exploited remotely if Web Console users click a series of maliciously crafted URLs. All versions prior to 7.11.2 are affected.`
