# [CVE-2021-22862](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server%403.0/admin/release-notes#3.0.1)

## Description

- `An improper access control vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that allowed an authenticated user with the ability to fork a repository to disclose Actions secrets for the parent repository of the fork. This vulnerability existed due to a flaw that allowed the base reference of a pull request to be updated to point to an arbitrary SHA or another pull request outside of the fork repository. By establishing this incorrect reference in a PR, the restrictions that limit the Actions secrets sent a workflow from forks could be bypassed. This vulnerability affected GitHub Enterprise Server version 3.0.0, 3.0.0.rc2, and 3.0.0.rc1. This vulnerability was reported via the GitHub Bug Bounty program.`
