# [CVE-2021-37666](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-37666)

## Description

- `TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. In affected versions an attacker can cause undefined behavior via binding a reference to null pointer in `tf.raw_ops.RaggedTensorToVariant`. The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/460e000de3a83278fb00b61a16d161b1964f15f4/tensorflow/core/kernels/ragged_tensor_to_variant_op.cc#L129) has an incomplete validation of the splits values, missing the case when the argument would be empty. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit be7a4de6adfbd303ce08be4332554dff70362612. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.`
