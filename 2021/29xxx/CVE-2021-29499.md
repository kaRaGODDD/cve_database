# [CVE-2021-29499](https://github.com/sylabs/sif/security/advisories/GHSA-4gh8-x3vv-phhg)

## Description

- `SIF is an open source implementation of the Singularity Container Image Format. The `siftool new` command and func siftool.New() produce predictable UUID identifiers due to insecure randomness in the version of the `github.com/satori/go.uuid` module used as a dependency. A patch is available in version >= v1.2.3 of the module. Users are encouraged to upgrade. As a workaround, users passing CreateInfo struct should ensure the `ID` field is generated using a version of `github.com/satori/go.uuid` that is not vulnerable to this issue.`
