## Description

- `This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Vector 35 Binary Ninja 2.3.2660 (Build ID 88f343c3). User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of BNDB files. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated data structure. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-13668.`
