## Description

- `Tough provides a set of Rust libraries and tools for using and generating the update framework (TUF) repositories.

When targets are cached or saved, files could be overwritten with arbitrary content anywhere on the system. A fix is available in version 0.12.0. No workarounds to this issue are known.`
