# [CVE-2021-41163](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-41163)

## Description

- `Discourse is an open source platform for community discussion. In affected versions maliciously crafted requests could lead to remote code execution. This resulted from a lack of validation in subscribe_url values. This issue is patched in the latest stable, beta and tests-passed versions of Discourse. To workaround the issue without updating, requests with a path starting /webhooks/aws path could be blocked at an upstream proxy.`
