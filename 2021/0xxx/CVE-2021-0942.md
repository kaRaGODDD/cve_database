# [CVE-2021-0942](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-0942)

## Description

- `The path in this case is a little bit convoluted. The end result is that via an ioctl an untrusted app can control the ui32PageIndex offset in the expression:sPA.uiAddr = page_to_phys(psOSPageArrayData->pagearray[ui32PageIndex]);With the current PoC this crashes as an OOB read. However, given that the OOB read value is ending up as the address field of a struct I think i seems plausible that this could lead to an OOB write if the attacker is able to cause the OOB read to pull an interesting kernel address. Regardless if this is a read or write, it is a High severity issue in the kernel.Product: AndroidVersions: Android SoCAndroid ID: A-238904312`
