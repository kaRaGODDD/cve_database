Once authenticated, a user can add names to their cart, and compose an email. Uploading an attachment for the email stores the attachment on the site in the /tmp_attach/ folder where it can be accessed with a GET request. There are no limitations on files that can be attached, allowing for malicious PHP code to be uploaded and interpreted by the server.`
