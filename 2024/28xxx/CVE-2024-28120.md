# [CVE-2024-28120](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-28120)

## Description

- `codeium-chrome is an open source code completion plugin for the chrome web browser. The service worker of the codeium-chrome extension doesn't check the sender when receiving an external message. This allows an attacker to host a website that will steal the user's Codeium api-key, and thus impersonate the user on the backend autocomplete server. This issue has not been addressed. Users are advised to monitor the usage of their API key.`
