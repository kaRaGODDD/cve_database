# [CVE-2024-23656](https://github.com/dexidp/dex/blob/70d7a2c7c1bb2646b1a540e49616cbc39622fb83/cmd/dex/serve.go#L425)

## Description

- `Dex is an identity service that uses OpenID Connect to drive authentication for other apps. Dex 2.37.0 serves HTTPS with insecure TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1. `cmd/dex/serve.go` line 425 seemingly sets TLS 1.2 as minimum version, but the whole `tlsConfig` is ignored after `TLS cert reloader` was introduced in v2.37.0. Configured cipher suites are not respected either. This issue is fixed in Dex 2.38.0.`
