## Description

- `Envoy is a high-performance edge/middle/service proxy. External authentication can be bypassed by downstream connections.

This issue has been addressed in released 1.29.1, 1.28.1, 1.27.3, and 1.26.7. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.`
