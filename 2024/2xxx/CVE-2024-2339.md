# [CVE-2024-2339](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-2339)

## Description

- `PostgreSQL Anonymizer v1.2 contains a vulnerability  that allows a user who owns a table to elevate to superuser. A user can define a masking function for a column and place malicious code in that function. When a privileged user applies the masking rules using the static masking or the anonymous dump method, the malicious code is executed and can grant escalated privileges to the malicious user. PostgreSQL Anonymizer v1.2 does provide a protection against this risk with the restrict_to_trusted_schemas option, but that protection is incomplete. Users that don't own a table, especially masked users cannot exploit this vulnerability. The problem is resolved in v1.3.`
