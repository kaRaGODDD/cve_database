# [CVE-2024-21599](https://supportportal.juniper.net/JSA75740)

## Description

- `
A Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime vulnerability in the Packet Forwarding Engine (PFE) of Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX Series allows an adjacent, unauthenticated attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS).

If an MX Series device receives PTP packets on an MPC3E that doesn't support PTP this causes a memory leak which will result in unpredictable behavior and ultimately in an MPC crash and restart.

To monitor for this issue, please use the following FPC vty level commands:

show heap
shows an increase in "LAN buffer" utilization and

show clksync ptp nbr-upd-info
shows non-zero "Pending PFEs" counter.

This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX Series with MPC3E:



  *  All versions earlier than 20.4R3-S3;
  *  21.1 versions earlier than 21.1R3-S4;
  *  21.2 versions earlier than 21.2R3;
