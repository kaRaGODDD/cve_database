# [CVE-2008-5554](http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/499124/100/0/threaded)

## Description

- `The XSS Filter in Microsoft Internet Explorer 8.0 Beta 2 does not properly handle some HTTP headers that appear after a CRLF sequence in a URI, which allows remote attackers to bypass the XSS protection mechanism and conduct XSS or redirection attacks, as demonstrated by the (1) Location and (2) Set-Cookie HTTP headers.  NOTE: the vendor has reportedly stated that the XSS Filter intentionally does not attempt to "address every conceivable XSS attack scenario."`
