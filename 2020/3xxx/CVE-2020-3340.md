# [CVE-2020-3340](https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-mlt-ise-strd-xss-nqFhTtx7)

## Description

- `Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker with administrative credentials to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the interface. These vulnerabilities are due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input that is processed by the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by injecting malicious code into specific pages of the interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or access sensitive, browser-based information. To exploit these vulnerabilities, an attacker would need valid administrative credentials.`
