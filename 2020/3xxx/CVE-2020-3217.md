# [CVE-2020-3217](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-3217)

## Description

- `A vulnerability in the Topology Discovery Service of Cisco One Platform Kit (onePK) in Cisco IOS Software, Cisco IOS XE Software, Cisco IOS XR Software, and Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient length restrictions when the onePK Topology Discovery Service parses Cisco Discovery Protocol messages. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious Cisco Discovery Protocol message to an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a stack overflow, which could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with administrative privileges, or to cause a process crash, which could result in a reload of the device and cause a DoS condition.`
