# [CVE-2020-10212](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-10212)

## Description

- `upload.php in Responsive FileManager 9.13.4 and 9.14.0 allows SSRF via the url parameter because file-extension blocking is mishandled and because it is possible for a DNS hostname to resolve to an internal IP address. For example, an SSRF attempt may succeed if a .ico filename is added to the PATH_INFO. Also, an attacker could create a DNS hostname that resolves to the 0.0.0.0 IP address for DNS pinning. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2018-14728.`
