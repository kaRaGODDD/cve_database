## Description

- `Mids' Reborn Hero Designer 2.6.0.7 downloads the update manifest, as well as update files, over cleartext HTTP.

An attacker can perform a man-in-the-middle attack against this connection and replace executable files with malicious versions, which the operating system then executes under the context of the user running Hero Designer.`
