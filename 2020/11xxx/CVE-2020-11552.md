# [CVE-2020-11552](http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/158820/ManageEngine-ADSelfService-Plus-6000-Remote-Code-Execution.html)

## Description

- `An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus before build 6003 because it does not properly enforce user privileges associated with a Certificate dialog. This vulnerability could allow an unauthenticated attacker to escalate privileges on a Windows host. An attacker does not require any privilege on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability. One option is the self-service option on the Windows login screen. Upon selecting this option, the thick-client software is launched, which connects to a remote ADSelfService Plus server to facilitate self-service operations. An unauthenticated attacker having physical access to the host could trigger a security alert by supplying a self-signed SSL certificate to the client. The View Certificate option from the security alert allows an attacker to export a displayed certificate to a file. This can further cascade to a dialog that can open Explorer as SYSTEM. By navigating from Explorer to \windows\system32, cmd.exe can be launched as a SYSTEM.`
