## Description

- `A vulnerability in Cisco Unified Communications Manager IM &amp; Presence Service (Unified CM IM&amp;P) Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause the Cisco XCP Authentication Service on an affected device to restart, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to improper handling of login requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted client login request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a process to crash, resulting in a DoS condition for new login attempts. Users who are authenticated at the time of the attack would not be affected. There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.`
