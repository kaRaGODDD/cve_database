# [CVE-2020-4040](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-4040)

## Description

- `Bolt CMS before version 3.7.1 lacked CSRF protection in the preview generating endpoint. Previews are intended to be generated by the admins, developers, chief-editors, and editors, who are authorized to create content in the application. But due to lack of proper CSRF protection, unauthorized users could generate a preview. This has been fixed in Bolt 3.7.1`
