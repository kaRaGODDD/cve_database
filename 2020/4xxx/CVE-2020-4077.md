# [CVE-2020-4077](https://github.com/electron/electron/security/advisories/GHSA-h9jc-284h-533g)

## Description

- `In Electron before versions 7.2.4, 8.2.4, and 9.0.0-beta21, there is a context isolation bypass. Code running in the main world context in the renderer can reach into the isolated Electron context and perform privileged actions. Apps using both `contextIsolation` and `contextBridge` are affected. This is fixed in versions 9.0.0-beta.21, 8.2.4 and 7.2.4.`
