# [CVE-2020-24264](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-24264)

## Description

- `Portainer 1.24.1 and earlier is affected by incorrect access control that may lead to remote arbitrary code execution. The restriction checks for bind mounts are applied only on the client-side and not the server-side, which can lead to spawning a container with bind mount. Once such a container is spawned, it can be leveraged to break out of the container leading to complete Docker host machine takeover.`
