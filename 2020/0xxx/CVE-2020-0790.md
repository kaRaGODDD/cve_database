# [CVE-2020-0790](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2020-0790)

## Description

- `<p>A local elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in how splwow64.exe handles certain calls. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could elevate privileges on an affected system from low-integrity to medium-integrity.</p>
<p>This vulnerability by itself does not allow arbitrary code execution; however, it could allow arbitrary code to be run if the attacker uses it in combination with another vulnerability (such as a remote code execution vulnerability or another elevation of privilege vulnerability) that is capable of leveraging the elevated privileges when code execution is attempted.</p>
<p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by ensuring splwow64.exe properly handles these calls..</p>
