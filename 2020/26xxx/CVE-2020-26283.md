## Description

- `go-ipfs is an open-source golang implementation of IPFS which is a global, versioned, peer-to-peer filesystem. In go-ipfs before version 0.8.0, control characters are not escaped from console output. This can result in hiding input from the user which could result in the user taking an unknown, malicious action. This is fixed in version 0.8.0.`
