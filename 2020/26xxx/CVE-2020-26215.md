# [CVE-2020-26215](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/commit/3cec4bbe21756de9f0c4bccf18cf61d840314d74)

## Description

- `Jupyter Notebook before version 6.1.5 has an Open redirect vulnerability. A maliciously crafted link to a notebook server could redirect the browser to a different website. All notebook servers are technically affected, however, these maliciously crafted links can only be reasonably made for known notebook server hosts. A link to your notebook server may appear safe, but ultimately redirect to a spoofed server on the public internet. The issue is patched in version 6.1.5.`
