# [CVE-2020-26266](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/ace0c15a22f7f054abcc1f53eabbcb0a1239a9e2)

## Description

- `In affected versions of TensorFlow under certain cases a saved model can trigger use of uninitialized values during code execution. This is caused by having tensor buffers be filled with the default value of the type but forgetting to default initialize the quantized floating point types in Eigen. This is fixed in versions 1.15.5, 2.0.4, 2.1.3, 2.2.2, 2.3.2, and 2.4.0.`
