# [CVE-2020-15262](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15262)

## Description

- `In webpack-subresource-integrity before version 1.5.1, all dynamically loaded chunks receive an invalid integrity hash that is ignored by the browser, and therefore the browser cannot validate their integrity. This removes the additional level of protection offered by SRI for such chunks. Top-level chunks are unaffected. This issue is patched in version 1.5.1.`
