# [CVE-2020-15114](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15114)

## Description

- `In etcd before versions 3.3.23 and 3.4.10, the etcd gateway is a simple TCP proxy to allow for basic service discovery and access. However, it is possible to include the gateway address as an endpoint. This results in a denial of service, since the endpoint can become stuck in a loop of requesting itself until there are no more available file descriptors to accept connections on the gateway.`
