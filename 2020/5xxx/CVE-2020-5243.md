# [CVE-2020-5243](https://github.com/ua-parser/uap-core/commit/0afd61ed85396a3b5316f18bfd1edfaadf8e88e1)

## Description

- `uap-core before 0.7.3 is vulnerable to a denial of service attack when processing crafted User-Agent strings. Some regexes are vulnerable to regular expression denial of service (REDoS) due to overlapping capture groups. This allows remote attackers to overload a server by setting the User-Agent header in an HTTP(S) request to maliciously crafted long strings. This has been patched in uap-core 0.7.3.`
