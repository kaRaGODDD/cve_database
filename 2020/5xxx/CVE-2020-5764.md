# [CVE-2020-5764](https://www.tenable.com/security/research/tra-2020-41)

## Description

- `MX Player Android App versions prior to v1.24.5, are vulnerable to a directory traversal vulnerability when user is using the MX Transfer feature in "Receive" mode. An attacker can exploit this by connecting to the MX Transfer session as a "sender" and sending a MessageType of "FILE_LIST" with a "name" field containing directory traversal characters (../). This will result in the file being transferred to the victim's phone, but being saved outside of the intended "/sdcard/MXshare" directory. In some instances, an attacker can achieve remote code execution by writing ".odex" and ".vdex" files in the "oat" directory of the MX Player application.`
