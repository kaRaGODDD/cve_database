# [CVE-2020-5222](https://github.com/opencast/opencast/commit/1a7172c95af8d542a77ae5b153e4c834dd4788a6)

## Description

- `Opencast before 7.6 and 8.1 enables a remember-me cookie based on a hash created from the username, password, and an additional system key. This means that an attacker getting access to a remember-me token for one server can get access to all servers which allow log-in using the same credentials without ever needing the credentials. This problem is fixed in Opencast 7.6 and Opencast 8.1`
