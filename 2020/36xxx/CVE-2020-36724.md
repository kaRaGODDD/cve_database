# [CVE-2020-36724](https://blog.nintechnet.com/wordpress-plugins-and-themes-vulnerabilities-roundup/)

## Description

- `The Wordable plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in versions up to, and including, 3.1.1. This is due to the use of a user supplied hashing algorithm passed to the hash_hmac() function and the use of a loose comparison on the hash which allows an attacker to trick the function into thinking it has a valid hash. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to gain administrator privileges.`
