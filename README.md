# CVE Database Repository

Welcome to the CVE Database repository! Here you will find a curated collection of CVE vulnerabilities gathered by me from the National Vulnerability Database (NVD). The vulnerabilities are presented in markdown (.md) files, where I have compiled all the necessary information as I see fit. In the future, I plan to add a JSON format to preserve the complete information from the NVD website.

## Features

- **Markdown Format:** Vulnerabilities are presented in markdown files for easy readability.
- **JSON Format (Future Enhancement):** Complete information retrieval from the NVD website.
- **Categorization Functionality (Planned):** Cataloging vulnerabilities based on organizations, operating systems, and other relevant parameters.

## Stay Updated

If you want to stay updated on the development progress, you can find the repository [here](https://github.com/kaRaGODDD/course_project/tree/second_version).

Feel free to explore, contribute, and keep an eye on the evolving CVE Database! Your suggestions and contributions are greatly appreciated.
