## Description

- `A vulnerability in the ingress packet processing function of Cisco IOS Software for Cisco Catalyst 4000 Series Switches could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper resource allocation when processing TCP packets directed to the device on specific Cisco Catalyst 4000 Series Switches. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted TCP streams to an affected device. A successful exploit could cause the affected device to run out of buffer resources, impairing operations of control plane and management plane protocols, resulting in a DoS condition. This vulnerability can be triggered only by traffic that is destined to an affected device and cannot be exploited using traffic that transits an affected device.`
