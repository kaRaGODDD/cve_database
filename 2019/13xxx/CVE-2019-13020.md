# [CVE-2019-13020](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-13020)

## Description

- `The fetch API in Tightrope Media Carousel before 7.1.3 has CarouselAPI/v0/fetch?url= SSRF. This has two potential areas for abuse. First, a specially crafted URL could be used in a phishing attack to hijack the trust the user and the browser have with the website and could serve malicious content from a third-party attacker-controlled system. Second, arguably more severe, is the potential for an attacker to circumvent firewall controls, by proxying traffic, unauthenticated, into the internal network from the internet.`
