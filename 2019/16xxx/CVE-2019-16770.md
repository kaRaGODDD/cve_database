# [CVE-2019-16770](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-16770)

## Description

- `In Puma before versions 3.12.2 and 4.3.1, a poorly-behaved client could use keepalive requests to monopolize Puma's reactor and create a denial of service attack. If more keepalive connections to Puma are opened than there are threads available, additional connections will wait permanently if the attacker sends requests frequently enough. This vulnerability is patched in Puma 4.3.1 and 3.12.2.`
