## Description

- `Multiple vulnerabilities in Cisco Webex Network Recording Player for Microsoft Windows and Cisco Webex Player for Microsoft Windows could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected system. The vulnerabilities exist because the affected software improperly validates Advanced Recording Format (ARF) and Webex Recording Format (WRF) files. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a user a malicious ARF or WRF file through a link or email attachment and persuading the user to open the file with the affected software on the local system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system with the privileges of the targeted user.`
