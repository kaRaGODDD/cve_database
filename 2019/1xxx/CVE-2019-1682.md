## Description

- `A vulnerability in the FUSE filesystem functionality for Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC) software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to escalate privileges to root on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation for certain command strings issued on the CLI of the affected device. An attacker with write permissions for files within a readable folder on the device could alter certain definitions in the affected file. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to cause the underlying FUSE driver to execute said crafted commands, elevating the attacker's privileges to root on an affected device.`
