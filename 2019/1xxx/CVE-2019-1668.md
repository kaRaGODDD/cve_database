# [CVE-2019-1668](http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/106720)

## Description

- `A vulnerability in the chat feed feature of Cisco SocialMiner could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to perform cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks against a user of the web-based user interface of an affected system. This vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input delivered to the chat feed as part of an HTTP request. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to follow a link to attacker-controlled content. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.`
