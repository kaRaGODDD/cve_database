## Description

- `A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the web-based management interface of an affected system. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input in the web-based management interface of the affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to access a report containing malicious content. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information. Versions 6.2.3, 6.3.0, and 6.4.0 are affected.`
