# [CVE-2019-10741](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-10741)

## Description

- `K-9 Mail v5.600 can include the original quoted HTML code of a specially crafted, benign looking, email within (digitally signed) reply messages. The quoted part can contain conditional statements that show completely different text if opened in a different email client. This can be abused by an attacker to obtain valid S/MIME or PGP signatures for arbitrary content to be displayed to a third party. NOTE: the vendor states "We don't plan to take any action because of this."`
