## Description

- `In Octopus Deploy versions 2018.8.4 to 2019.7.6, when a web request proxy is configured, an authenticated user (in certain limited special-characters circumstances) could trigger a deployment that writes the web request proxy password to the deployment log in cleartext. This is fixed in 2019.7.7. The fix was back-ported to LTS 2019.6.7 as well as LTS 2019.3.8.`
