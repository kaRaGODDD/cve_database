# [CVE-2019-19903](https://backdropcms.org/security/backdrop-sa-core-2019-015)

## Description

- `An issue was discovered in Backdrop CMS 1.14.x before 1.14.2. It doesn't sufficiently filter output when displaying file type descriptions created by administrators. An attacker could potentially craft a specialized description, then have an administrator execute scripting when viewing the list of file types, aka XSS. This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have a role with the "Administer file types" permission.`
