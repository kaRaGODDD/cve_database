# [CVE-2019-14748](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-14748)

## Description

- `An issue was discovered in osTicket before 1.10.7 and 1.12.x before 1.12.1. The Ticket creation form allows users to upload files along with queries. It was found that the file-upload functionality has fewer (or no) mitigations implemented for file content checks; also, the output is not handled properly, causing persistent XSS that leads to cookie stealing or malicious actions. For example, a non-agent user can upload a .html file, and Content-Disposition will be set to inline instead of attachment.`
