# [CVE-2019-14757](https://research.nccgroup.com/2020/08/21/technical-advisory-multiple-html-injection-vulnerabilities-in-kaios-pre-installed-mobile-applications/)

## Description

- `An issue was discovered in KaiOS 2.5 and 2.5.1. The pre-installed Contacts application is vulnerable to HTML and JavaScript injection attacks. An attacker can send a vCard file to the victim that will inject HTML into the Contacts application (assuming the victim chooses to import the file). At a bare minimum, this allows an attacker to take control over the Contacts application's UI (e.g., display a malicious prompt to the user asking them to re-enter credentials such as their KaiOS credentials to continue using the application) and also allows an attacker to abuse any of the privileges available to the mobile application.`
