# [CVE-2018-20405](https://github.com/bigtreecms/BigTree-CMS/issues/354)

## Description

- `BigTree 4.3 allows full path disclosure via authenticated admin/news/ input that triggers a syntax error. NOTE: This has been disputed with the following reasoning: "The issue reported requires full developer level access to the content management system where cross site scripting is not an issue -- you already have full control of the CMS including running arbitrary PHP.`
