## Description

- `Technicolor (formerly RCA) TC8305C devices allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (networking outage) via a flood of random MAC addresses, as demonstrated by macof. NOTE: this might overlap CVE-2018-15852 and CVE-2018-16310. NOTE: Technicolor denies that the described behavior is a vulnerability and states that Wi-Fi traffic is slowed or stopped only while the devices are exposed to a MAC flooding attack. This has been confirmed through testing against official up-to-date versions`
