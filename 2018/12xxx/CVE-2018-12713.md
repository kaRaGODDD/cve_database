# [CVE-2018-12713](https://github.com/GNOME/gimp/commit/c21eff4b031acb04fb4dfce8bd5fdfecc2b6524f)

## Description

- `GIMP through 2.10.2 makes g_get_tmp_dir calls to establish temporary filenames, which may result in a filename that already exists, as demonstrated by the gimp_write_and_read_file function in app/tests/test-xcf.c. This might be leveraged by attackers to overwrite files or read file content that was intended to be private.`
