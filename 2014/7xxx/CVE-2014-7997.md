## Description

- `The DHCP implementation in Cisco IOS on Aironet access points does not properly handle error conditions with short leases and unsuccessful lease-renewal attempts, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (device restart) by triggering a transition into a recovery state that was intended to involve a network-interface restart but actually involves a full device restart, aka Bug ID CSCtn16281.`
