# [CVE-2006-1966](http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/fulldisclosure/2006-04/0449.html)

## Description

- `An unspecified Fortinet product, possibly Fortinet28, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service via a "small synflood" to the SMTP port (TCP port 25), as demonstrated by a 10-microsecond wait between sending packets.  NOTE: this issue has been disputed in followup posts that suggest that a protection feature is triggering a RST.`
