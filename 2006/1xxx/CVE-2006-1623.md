# [CVE-2006-1623](http://attrition.org/pipermail/vim/2006-April/000680.html)

## Description

- `Unspecified vulnerability in main.php in an unspecified "file created by Andries Bruinsma," possibly a FleXiBle Development (FXB) application, allows remote attackers to include and execute arbitrary PHP code.  NOTE: this disclosure is extremely vague and has very little information about the specific vulnerability type.  In addition, there is little public information on the named product. Finally, an XSS vector is implied in the subject line, but because there is no other information and evidence of a cut-and-paste error, it will not be assigned a separate CVE identifier unless additional information is provided.`
