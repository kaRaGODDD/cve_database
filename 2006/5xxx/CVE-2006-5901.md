# [CVE-2006-5901](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-5901)

## Description

- `Hawking Technology wireless router WR254-CA uses a hardcoded IP address among the set of DNS server IP addresses, which could allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service or hijack the router by attacking or spoofing the server at the hardcoded address.  NOTE: it could be argued that this issue reflects an inherent limitation of DNS itself, so perhaps it should not be included in CVE.`
